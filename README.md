[INSTALL CHROME EXTENSION](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-minesweeper/digafonkkgaabmggclpbabfmfnambeia/related)

### Description

Classic minesweeper game on GitHub profile page using calendar contributions chart.

After installing it, you will see main game controls just above the contributions grid. Choose a number of mines and click the "Play" button to start a new game and the contributions grid will become a minesweeper board.

Rules of the game are the classic ones: each cell could have a mine or not, if you click a cell that contains a mine, the game is over, otherwise, the cell will reveal how many adjacent cells contain mines. Using these clues, the goal is to reveal all non-mined cells.

Of course, you can hide the game board anytime to be able to keep using GitHub profile pages as usual by clicking the "eye" button.

Left mouse click to reveal a cell content and right mouse click to mark a cell as mined.
